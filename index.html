                (Summary) Designed for IJCAI 2024 on Jeju Island, the “Sustainable Transition with AI (STAI)” workshop is a full-day event that explores the pivotal role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in advancing global and local sustainability initiatives. STAI will spotlight the innovative use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), agents, data science, and Machine Learning (ML) in scrutinizing and enhancing sustainability communications.

            An NLP Benchmark Dataset for Assessing Corporate Climate Policy Engagement

                (Summary) As societal awareness of climate change grows, corporate climate policy engagements are attracting attention. We propose a dataset to estimate corporate climate policy engagement from various PDF-formatted documents. Our dataset comes from LobbyMap (a platform operated by global think tank InfluenceMap) that provides engagement categories and stances on the documents. To convert the LobbyMap data into the structured dataset, we developed a pipeline using text extraction and OCR. Our contributions are: (i) Building an NLP dataset including 10K documents on corporate climate policy engagement. (ii) Analyzing the properties and challenges of the dataset. (iii) Providing experiments for the dataset using pre-trained language models. The results show that while Longformer outperforms baselines and other pre-trained models, there is still room for significant improvement. We hope our work begins to bridge research on NLP and climate change.

                (Data) The dataset used in this analysis is part of InfluenceMap's content and was used and is released with the latter's approval.   InfluenceMap maintains (since 2015) an ongoing database containing millions of data points each consisting of evidence pieces around corporate climate/nature claims and performance.  These are scored against globally accepted science based benchmarks such as the IPCC and the IPBES.  Subsets of this data for ML/AI and other analysis are available by request from InfluenceMap and use of InfluenceMap's content is subject to <a href="https://influencemap.org/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>.

            <li>
                (Summary) We introduce ReportParse, a Python-based tool designed to parse corporate sustainability reports.
                It combines document structure analysis with natural language processing (NLP) models to extract sustainability-related information from the reports.
                We also provide easy-to-use web and command interfaces.
                The tool is expected to aid researchers and analysts in evaluating corporate commitment to and management of sustainability efforts.

            Predicting Narratives of Climate Obstruction in Social Media Advertising
        </h3>

            <li>(Author) Harri Rowlands, Gaku Morio, Dylan Tanner, and Christopher D. Manning</li>

            <li>
                (Summary) Social media advertising offers a platform for fossil fuel value chain companies and their agents to reinforce their narratives, often emphasizing economic, labor market, and energy security benefits to promote oil and gas policy and products. 
                Whether such narratives can be detected automatically and the extent to which the cost of human annotation can be reduced is our research question. 
                We introduce a task of classifying narratives into seven categories, based on existing definitions and data.
                Experiments showed that RoBERTa-large outperforms other methods, while GPT-4 turbo can serve as a viable annotator for the task, thereby reducing human annotation costs. Our findings and insights provide guidance to automate climate-related ad analysis and lead to more scalable ad scrutiny.
