                (Summary) As societal awareness of climate change grows, corporate climate policy engagements are attracting attention. We propose a dataset to estimate corporate climate policy engagement from various PDF-formatted documents. Our dataset comes from LobbyMap (a platform operated by global think tank InfluenceMap) that provides engagement categories and stances on the documents. To convert the LobbyMap data into the structured dataset, we developed a pipeline using text extraction and OCR. Our contributions are: (i) Building an NLP dataset including 10K documents on corporate climate policy engagement. (ii) Analyzing the properties and challenges of the dataset. (iii) Providing experiments for the dataset using pre-trained language models. The results show that while Longformer outperforms baselines and other pre-trained models, there is still room for significant improvement. We hope our work begins to bridge research on NLP and climate change.

                (Data) The dataset used in this analysis is part of InfluenceMap's content and was used and is released with the latter's approval.   InfluenceMap maintains (since 2015) an ongoing database containing millions of data points each consisting of evidence pieces around corporate climate/nature claims and performance.  These are scored against globally accepted science based benchmarks such as the IPCC and the IPBES.  Subsets of this data for ML/AI and other analysis are available by request from InfluenceMap and use of InfluenceMap's content is subject to <a href="https://influencemap.org/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>.
